#### By Micaela Jawor

----------

## Description
'No Going Back' is a platformer game designed using HTML and JavaScript, where you play as a simple ember trying to find his own candle. As the player, navigate through the levels, where each movement forward is final, returning to a burnt tile will only cause an early End Game. Face dire enemies, such as Ice Cubes, Water Droplets, and Electric Fans. Be careful of your movement choices, because sometimes your greatest enemy is yourself. The game features original story, levels, expandable core mechanics, and artwork.
